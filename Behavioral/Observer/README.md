Design and implement a file monitoring system using the Observer Design Pattern in Java.
- Create an abstract Subject class that represents a file. The Subject class should include a list of registered observers and methods to register and unregister observers. Additionally, it should include a method to notify the observers of changes in the file.
- Implement a ConcreteSubject class that extends the Subject class. This class should monitor a specific file for changes and notify its observers of any changes made to the file.
- Create an abstract Observer class that represents a file monitor. The Observer class should include an update method that is called by the subject to notify the observer of a change in the file.
- Implement a ConcreteObserver class that extends the Observer class. This class should have a name and a method to display the details of the file change (e.g. the name of the file, the type of change made, the time of the change).
- In the main method of your program, create a ConcreteSubject object and register one or more ConcreteObserver objects to it. Then, simulate changes to the file being monitored and verify that the observers are notified of the changes.
